      <p>
        My name is Malorie Alyssa Lara.  I am 22 years old and enjoy many things, but 
        particularly, spending time at home or with friends.  I am a home-body person 
        but when I'm out with friends, I like to be active and social.  My family consists 
        of my mom, Rebecca, dad, Jose, sister, Hailea, and two little dogs, Eloise and Hazel.
    </p>

      <p>
        Throughout my life I have played many sports, but since I was 9, I have loved 
        soccer the most.  When I was 10, I had a spiral fracture that you would think 
        would have kept me from playing, but it didn't.  It actually made me that much 
        more excited and tough for the upcoming seasons.  
    </p>

      <p>
        When it came to college, I wanted to be close enough to home but also far enough 
        to where I was able to become my own person and do my own things.  I chose a school 
        that was about an hour away.  That school was Southwestern University.  I was able 
        to fulfill my dreams and play soccer for the university at the collegiate level.  
        I was also able to check off a goal when I scored my first collegiate hat-trick my 
        sophomore year. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Some hobbies I enjoy are: Soccer/Sports, Kayaking, Paddleboarding, Swimming, 
        Relaxing and sipping on Margs or a beer with my friends.
